#### ODE methods for simulation

Uses Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to simulate the movement of a pendulum. The methods included in the codes contain: 
* Euler's method
* The improved Euler's method (or known as Heun's method or trapezoidal rule method)
* Runge-Kutta integration
* Semi-implicit Euler method (or known as symplectic Euler)
